## csw-words-10000.txt
List of the most 'useful' words in the lexicon, where usefulness is measured as the average number of points scored per game by plays that involve that word, when macondo is playing against itself.
The 10,000 most useful words are included. Unsurprisingly, QI is the most useful word in the lexicon to know, and the rest of the most useful words align with the usual advice for which words to learn: all 2-letter and most 3- letter words, 4-6 letter words containing JQXZ, and 7-letter and 8-letter words played as bingos from high-probability racks.

## csw-undefined-in-wiktionary.txt
